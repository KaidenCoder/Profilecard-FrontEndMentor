## My process

I first built the HTML tag and experimented with every HTML class with CSS properties.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am proud of learning CSS background-image properties

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  background: url(./images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
    url(./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
  background-position: right 50vw bottom 30vh, left 50vw top 30vh;
  background-color: rgb(25, 162, 174);
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed, fixed;
  background-size: auto;
  height: 100vh;
  font-family: "Lucida Sans", "Lucida Sans Regular", "Lucida Grande",
    "Lucida Sans Unicode", Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) -
  There are many websites I have visited, and W3Schools is the most.
- [Github code](https://github.com/pilatopus/profile-card.github.io/blob/main/style.css) - When I could not change my background image CSS, I decided to look at someone else's code for the same project. It helps me solve my final hurdle.
